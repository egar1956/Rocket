# 3 - High Endurance Flash 

A simple example of support/use of the **High Endurance Flash** Memory

* Device: PIC16F1619 
* Board: Curiosity (DM164137)
* MPLAB X , XC8 and MPLAB Code Configurator


## The Basic Idea
* High Endurance Flash (HEF) memory is available on **all** PIC16F1 devices without a dedicated EEPROM module.
* The content of the HEF *can* be written and read using the standard Flash memory drivers generated by MPLAB X Code Configurator **but** this requires precise physical address calculations and care in the translation between data bytes and memory words.
* The *HEF.c* and *HEF.h* files build *on top of* the MCC generated drivers and offer easy, safe and fast access to HEF for **data storage**.

    * Up to 32 bytes of data can be written in a single write cycle (2ms)!
    * Up to 4 High Endurance blocks can be managed independently!
     
  
## Details
Remember to:

* Reserve the HEF memory by adding the following option to the MPLAB X project configuration: XC8 Linker, Additional Options:   
    * `--ROM=default,-1f80-1fff `    (for a 8K word device such as PIC16F1619)
    * `--ROM=default,-f80-fff `    (for a 4K word device such as PIC16F1615)
    * `--ROM=default,-780-7ff `    (for a 2K word device such as PIC16F1613)
    * ...
* Enable Low Voltage Programming (Needed by the Curiosity on-board programmer), it can be found in CONFIG2 (System page).
