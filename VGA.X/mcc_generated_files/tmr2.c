  @Summary
    This is the generated driver implementation file for the TMR2 driver using MPLAB� Code Configurator

  @Description
    This source file provides APIs for TMR2.
    Generation Information :
        Product Revision  :  MPLAB� Code Configurator - v2.25.2
        Device            :  PIC16F1619
